Explanation of some technical and subject specific terms used in the system.

## Sector, segment or leg
A sector is, by definition, a portion of an itinerary, or journey, which may consist of one or more legs or segments. A leg is the portion of a journey between two consecutive scheduled stops on any particular flight. A segment is that portion of a journey, from a boarding point of a passenger, to a deplaning point of the given flight. Although the passenger may not leave the plane, it may tough down to take on or let off passengers at several points, so that a segment may be made up of a leg or group of legs.

## Stopover
Stopover means a stop at an intermediate point from which the passenger is not scheduled to depart on the day of arrival. If there is no schedule connecting departure on the day of arrival, departure on the next day within 24 h after the time of arrival will not constitute a stopover.

## Outbound
An outbound flight is the flight in which you leave you current city/town to wherever you booked your flight to.

## Inbound
Your Inbound flight is always the flight coming back from the destination you flew to in the first place.
